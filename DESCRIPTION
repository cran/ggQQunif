Title: Compare Big Datasets to the Uniform Distribution
Version: 0.1.5
Authors@R: person("Robert", "Corty", email = "rcorty@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A quantile-quantile plot can be used to compare a sample of p-values 
  to the uniform distribution.  But when the dataset is big (i.e. > 1e4 p-values),
  plotting the quantile-quantile plot can be slow.  geom_QQ uses all the data to
  calculate the quantiles, but thins it out in a way that focuses on points near zero 
  before plotting to speed up plotting and decrease file size, when vector graphics are stored.
